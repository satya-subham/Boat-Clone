            Most of us are tethered to our devices for at least some part of the
            day, listening to music, gaming, watching videos on tablet, phones
            or laptops. Our headphones are not merely an accessory anymore -
            they are practically an extension of ourselves. Want to stay tuned
            to your favorite beats or want to indulge in a movie marathon
            without disturbing the ones around you - the right pair of earphones
            will allow you to do all of this and a lot more!

          <p class="guide_para">But how to find the ‘right’ ones?</p>

          <p class="guide_para">
            Is that a question which is bothering you as well? Well, the sheer
            amount of <span class="earphone_text_span">earphones</span> online
            choices in type, shape, and size can really be confusing! On top of
            that, there are a lot of factors that matter while choosing your
            headphones that you might not be aware of.

          <p class="guide_para">
            There’s only one way to navigate through all this, that is to learn
            about the specifics and understand the jargon. You’re probably

          <h2 class="content_heading">A. In-ear Design</h2>

          <p class="in_ear_design_para">
            You might know them by various names like
            <span class="earbud_text_span">earbuds</span>, in-ear headphones,
            these are the smallest and most portable type of earphones. They
            rest in the bowl of the ear, outside the ear canal, though a portion
            might extend into the canal. They have foam or rubber tips to give
            you comfort.
          </p>

          <p class="in_ear_design_para">
            Some models, particularly sports centric ones, come equipped with
            wings or fins for a tailored and secure fit. These insert-style
            models when inserted into the canals often form a seal that can help
            keep out the extraneous noise. They are extremely popular these days
            due to their stylish looks and convenience.
          </p>

          <p class="in_ear_design_para">
            Talking about the benefits of this design - the first thing that
            comes to the mind is their small size and hence the portability they
            offer. You can stuff them in your pockets or carry them in your
            palm. They don’t mess up your hair or interfere with your glasses or
            earrings! You can carry them effortlessly and always be at your
            stylish best!
          </p>

          <h2 class="content_heading">B. Ear Clip Design</h2>

          <p class="ear_clip_design">
            If you are looking for a middle ground between huge and bulky
            headphones and extremely compact and portable earbuds, then ear-clip
            design earphones are meant for you. In a lot of ways they carry the
            best of both.
          </p>

          <p class="ear_clip_design">
            These headphones are compact and have ear-loops to keep them in
            place. Mind you they are not like having ear tips, but a complete
            feature hook that fits over the ears and connects to your music
            device via Bluetooth or audio jack. This makes them easier to carry
            around than heavy headphones and more comfortable than earbuds.
          </p>

          <p class="ear_clip_design">
            On-ear clip-on headphones bestow protection to the user from
            different kinds of gory bacteria that might enter the ear canal and
            lead to infections.
          </p>

          <h2 class="content_heading">C. Behind the Neck Design</h2>

          <p class="neck_design">
            We are sure you have already seen people wearing these high-tech
            collars with headphones sprouting out the sides. They go around with
            different names like - neckband headphones, collar headphones or
            even behind the neck headphones.
          </p>

          <p class="neck_design">
            This distinctive style of design offers them multiple advantages.
            The first major advantage is quite an obvious one, but still worth
            pointing out - they are always around whenever you want them. Given
            that the earbuds are hanging around your neck, mere inches away from
            your ears, you won’t have to dig through your bag or pockets when
            you want to listen to your favorite tune or take a call.
          </p>

          <p class="neck_design">
            Apart from this, they also come with many surprises like convenient
            controls, better mics that are nearer to the mouth, and bigger
            batteries. In the end, they say ‘I am on the go’ or ‘I am active’
            and add that extra edge to your personality -<span>

          <p class="wired_earphones">
            You are most probably familiar with and already used these types of
            earphones. They come with dependable wire which you have to insert
            into your source of music. They come with their own set of
            advantages and disadvantages:
          </p>

          <p class="wired_earphones">
            Let’s start with the pros. First and foremost, they offer a stable
            and lag-free connectivity, which in return ensures top class audio
            clarity. Audiophiles typically swear by their audio output. On top
            of that you do not have to worry about charging them.
          </p>

          <p class="wired_earphones">
            However, dealing with the wire can be slightly problematic for some.
            When left unattended, they turn into a knotty (pun intended) mess.
            But if that’s the concern, then you can always opt for the ones that
            come with a tangle-free wire. For example:
            <span>Bassheads 242</span> ,<span>Bassheads 100</span> , Bassheads
            152 will provide you with extraordinary sound quality and you do not
            even have to worry about untangling the wire frequently -

          <h2 class="content_heading">Wireless Earphones</h2>

          <p class="wireless_earphones">
            Wireless earphones are already a rage! All thanks to the fact that
            they allow you the freedom to go ‘wireless’ meaning groove to the
            beats of your favorite tunes without any restrictions. You ask why?
            As most of the wireless earphones use bluetooth to connect to the
            source of music! Another advantage of these bluetooth earphones is
            that you can carry them anywhere -

              Audiophile or not - we are sure that the quality of sound is a
              concern for all when considering buying the perfect earphones. Be
              it music, podcasts or movies - you want a pair that does justice
              to every note and ensures that you get to listen to your music the
              way it’s meant to be!
            </p>

            <p class="sound_quality_para">
              Drivers are one such core component of any headphone that are
              instrumental in ensuring good sound quality. They boost the bass,
              mids and the treble to allow for an enjoyable listening
              experience. They basically convert the electrical signal feed to
              the headphones into an audible sound signal that can be perceived
              by the human ear. There are various types of drivers that are used
              in earphones, including the most commonly used moving coil
              (dynamic) drivers, balanced armature drivers, planar magnetic
              drivers and electrostatic drivers, among others. They use
              different technologies to power the sound, with some technologies
              offering better, more powerful sound than others. They also
              provide better isolation due to the absence of a vent within.
            </p>

            <p class="sound_quality_para">
              In most cases, the larger the driver, the better the overall sound
              quality. For example, boAt’s <span> Airdopes 381</span> come with

              Sound quality, of course, is important to everybody; but for some,
              big bass is a must. It supplies the music’s weight & power and
              gives one a feeling of movement or thump. If you are someone who
              enjoys bass-heavy genres like EDM, funk or metal, you would
              definitely understand the importance of having a powerful device
              as the non-bass heavy earphones can really be a bummer.

              Apart from listening to your favorite tunes, you are going to use

            <p class="mic_quality_para">
              That’s why it’s always important to have a look at the mic quality

              noise cancellation? Is the mic of the earphone even located near
              the mouth? Keep in mind all of these things before making the
              plunge. boAt has designed various products like Bassheads 225

              Let's just admit - we are a little careless when it comes to

              and tear - be it dust, splash of water - or even sweat - anything
              can cause them damage! For example - if you depend on music to

              For those of you who have only used wired earphones, the fact that
              wireless earphones have a limited battery life might be an alien
              concept. As they are tethered to your device over bluetooth, they
              come with rechargeable batteries that need fuel (read charge) to
              make them work. That’s why it’s very much important to check how
              many uninterrupted hours of listening time you can get per charge
              with your wireless earphones.
            </p>

            <p class="playback_time_para">
              The best thing about wireless earbuds is that they often come with
              a carry cum charging case that provide additional hours of charge.
              So always check for the number of hours when it comes to the
              playback time. However, it might vary a little as per your use,
              but it’s always advisable to go for the ones which have a decent
              battery life.

            Are you a fitness enthusiast or trying to get into shape - good

            hear-through or transparency modes). And since getting into shape or
            maintaining a shape is not an easy task, you are going to sweat out
            a lot, you need to ensure that your earphones are at least
            sweat-resistant, if not fully waterproof. They should ensure that

            important - you definitely don’t want your earphones to die on you
            in the middle of an important battle! Last but not the least, your
            ear pieces should be comfortable and you should be able to wear them
